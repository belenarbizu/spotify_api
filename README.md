# spotify_api
This project allows users to interact with the Spotify API to retrieve their profile information and top tracks. It consists of two main functionalities:

User Profile Display: Displays the user's profile information, including their username, followers count, and profile image, by fetching data from Spotify's me endpoint.

Top Tracks Display: Shows the user's most listened tracks over a long-term period by calling Spotify's top/tracks API endpoint.


### Files

userProfile.js: A script that fetches and displays the user's Spotify profile information.

topTracks.js: A script that fetches and displays the user's top tracks over a long-term period.


### Setup

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies using npm install (requirements.txt).

Run the server with node userProfile.js or node long-termTopSongs.js depending on which functionality you want to test.
